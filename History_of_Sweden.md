> The history of Sweden can be traced back to the melting of the Northern polar ice cap. 
> From as early as 12000 BC, humans have inhabited this area. 
> 
> Throughout the Stone Age, between 8000 BC and 6000 BC, 
> early inhabitants used stone-crafting methods to make tools and weapons 
> for hunting, gathering and fishing as means of survival. 
> 
> Written sources about Sweden before AD 1000 are rare and short, usually written by outsiders. 
> It is usually accepted that Swedish recorded history, in contrast with pre-history, 
> starts around the late 10th century, 
> when sources are common enough that they can be contrasted with each other.
>
> The modern Swedish state was formed over a long period of unification and consolidation. 
> Historians have set different standards for when it can be considered complete. 
> 
> Some common laws were present from the second half of the 13th century. 
> At this time, Sweden consisted of most of what is today the southern part of the country 
> (except for Scania, Blekinge, Halland and Bohuslän), as well as parts of modern Finland. 
> Over the following centuries, Swedish influence would expand into the North and East.
>
> In the late 14th century Sweden, Denmark and Norway were united in the Kalmar Union. 
> During the following century, a series of rebellions lessened Sweden's ties to the union, 
> sometimes even leading to the election of a separate Swedish king. 
> 
> The fighting reached a climax following the Stockholm Bloodbath in 1520, 
> a mass execution of accused heretics orchestrated by Christian II of Denmark. 
> 
> One of the few members of the most powerful noble families not present, Gustav Vasa, 
> was able to raise a new rebellion and eventually was crowned King in 1523. 
> His reign proved lasting and marked the end of Sweden's participation in the Kalmar Union. 
> 
> Gustav Vasa furthermore encouraged Protestant preachers, 
> finally breaking with the papacy and establishing the Lutheran Church in Sweden, 
> seizing Catholic Church property and wealth.
>
> During the 17th century, 
> after winning wars against Denmark–Norway, Russia, and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, 
> Sweden emerged as a great power by taking direct control of the Baltic region. 
> 
> Sweden's role in the Thirty Years' War determined the political and religious balance of power in Europe. 
> The Swedish Empire expanded enormously into the modern Estonia and Latvia, 
> northern Germany, and several regions that to this day are part of Sweden.
>
> Before the end of the 17th century, a secret alliance was formed 
> between Denmark–Norway, Poland–Lithuania, and Russia against Sweden. 
> This coalition acted at the start of the 18th century 
> when Denmark–Norway and Poland launched surprise attacks on Sweden. 
> In 1721, Russia and its allies won the war against Sweden. 
> As a result, Russia was able to annex the Swedish territories of Estonia, Livonia, Ingria, and Karelia. 
> This effectively put an end to the Swedish Empire, and crippled her Baltic Sea power. 
> 
> Sweden joined in the Enlightenment culture of the day 
> in the arts, architecture, science, and learning. 
> Between 1570 and 1800, Sweden experienced two periods of urban expansion. 
> Finland was lost to Russia in a war in 1808–1809.
>
> Sweden's last war was the Swedish–Norwegian War (1814). 
> Sweden was victorious in this war, 
> leading to the Danish king being forced to cede Norway to Sweden. 
> Norway was then forced to enter into a personal union with Sweden that lasted until 1905. 
> Since 1814, Sweden has been at peace, adopting a non-aligned foreign policy in peacetime 
> and neutrality in wartime. 
> 
> During World War I, Sweden remained neutral, but let the Germans travel in the country. 
> Post-war prosperity provided the foundations for the social welfare policies characteristic of modern Sweden. 
> 
> During World War II, Sweden once again remained neutral, avoiding the fate of occupied Norway.
>
> The country attempted to stay out of alliances 
> and remain officially neutral during the entire Cold War, and declined to join NATO. 
> The social democratic party held government for 44 years (1932–1976). 
> The 1976 parliamentary elections brought a liberal/right-wing coalition to power. 
> 
> The neutrality policy was dropped in 2022, in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, 
> and Sweden formally became a member of NATO in March 2024.
