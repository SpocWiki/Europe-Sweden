> The 25 provinces of Sweden (Swedish: Sveriges landskap) are historical, 
> geographical and cultural regions. 
> They have no administrative function (except in some sports contexts), 
> but retain their own cultural identities, dialects and folklore.
>
> Several were administrative subdivisions until 1634, 
> when they were replaced by the counties of Sweden (län). 
> Some were conquered later on from Denmark–Norway. 
> Others, like the provinces of Finland, have been lost.
>
> In some cases, the county and province borders correspond almost exactly, 
> as with Blekinge and Blekinge County. 
> The island of Gotland is both a province, a county and a municipality (kommun). 
> The only other province to share a name with a modern municipality is Härjedalen, 
> though the borders are not quite the same. 
> Administrative borders are subject to change – for example, 
> several of today’s counties were created in the 1990s – 
> while the provincial borders have remained stable for centuries. 
> All the provinces are also ceremonial duchies, 
> but as such have no administrative or political functions.
>
> Nevertheless, the provinces of Sweden are no archaic concept; 
> they are still referenced in everyday speech and seen as culturally distinct. 
> The main exception is Lapland, 
> where people see themselves as citizens of Västerbotten or Norrbotten, 
> based on the counties.
>
> Sweden’s two largest cities, Stockholm and Gothenburg, 
> both have provincial borders running through them: 
> Stockholm is split between Uppland and Södermanland, 
> and Gothenburg is split between Västergötland and Bohuslän. 
> 
> According to a 2011 survey, people in major cities – Stockholm, Gothenburg 
> and, to a lesser extent, Malmö – identify primarily with their city, 
> rather than their province.
